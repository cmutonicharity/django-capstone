    <h1>The History of Rwanda</h1>
        <h3>Pre-Colonial Era:</h3>

    <p>Rwanda's history dates back to the pre-colonial era when the region was inhabited by the Twa, a Pygmy hunter-gatherer people. Later, the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups settled in the region, forming complex social structures and kingdoms.</p>

    <h3>Kingdom of Rwanda:</h3>

    <p>By the 15th century, the Kingdom of Rwanda had emerged, ruled by the Tutsi minority. The Mwami (king) held centralized control, and the kingdom was known for its elaborate social hierarchy.</p>

    <h3>Colonial Period:</h3>

    <p>In the late 19th century, Rwanda became a part of German East Africa. After World War I, the League of Nations mandated the territory to Belgium. The Belgians continued to rule through the existing Tutsi monarchy but exacerbated ethnic tensions by introducing racial ideologies and identity cards.</p>

    <h3>Independence:</h3>

    <p>Rwanda gained independence from Belgium on July 1, 1962. The transition was marked by social unrest and violence, particularly against the Tutsi minority.</p>

    <h3>Post-Independence Struggles:</h3>

    <p>The years following independence were turbulent, with ongoing ethnic tensions, political assassinations, and military coups. Economic challenges and regional instability further compounded Rwanda's struggles.</p>

    <h3>The Genocide Against the Tutsi:</h3>

    <p>In 1994, Rwanda witnessed one of the darkest chapters in its history. In just 100 days, an estimated 800,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu extremists. The genocide ended with the victory of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by current President Paul Kagame.</p>

    <h3>Recovery and Reconciliation:</h3>

    <p>Since the genocide, Rwanda has embarked on a path of recovery and reconciliation. The government has implemented various initiatives to foster unity and rebuild the nation. Rwanda's economy has seen significant growth, and the country is often cited as a model for post-conflict reconstruction.</p>

    <h3>Modern Rwanda:</h3>

    <p>Today, Rwanda is known for its progressive policies, commitment to environmental sustainability, and efforts to empower women in leadership roles. The nation continues to face challenges but stands as a symbol of resilience and hope.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Rwanda's history is a complex tapestry of cultural richness, colonial influence, tragic conflict, and inspiring recovery. The nation's journey offers profound insights into the human condition and the power of reconciliation and renewal.</p>
